DESCRIPTION
===========
In smithy_function, the smithy card lets the player draw 4 cards when it is only supposed to allow for 3 cards to be drawn. This bug was found using my cardtest1 unit test for the smithy card, as well as my randomtestcard1 random test for the smithy card.

1. Make dominion.o, rngs.o, and cardtest1steinaua files using gcc compiler
2. Run cardtest1steinaua
3. Examine test results

EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------
Playing the Smithy card should allow the player to draw 3 cards and add them to their hand.

* Even though my teammate did not refactor the code for the sea_hag card, my cardtest3 unit test for sea_hag still found the bug that incorrectly decrements the deck count.
