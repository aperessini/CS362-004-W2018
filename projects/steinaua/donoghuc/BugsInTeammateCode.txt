BUGS FOUND IN donoghuc DOMINION CODE
------------------------------------
1. In smithy_function, the smithy card lets the player draw 4 cards when it is only supposed to allow for 3 cards to be drawn. This bug was found using my cardtest1 unit test for the smithy card, as well as my randomtestcard1 random test for the smithy card.

2. Even though my teammate did not refactor the code for the sea_hag card, my cardtest3 unit test for sea_hag still found the bug that incorrectly decrements the deck count.

3. In council_room_function, the council_room card is not granting an extra buy to the current player as it should. This bug was found using my cardtest4 unit test for the council_room card, as well as my randomtestcard2 random test for council_room.
